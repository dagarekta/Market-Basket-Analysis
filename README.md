Business Problem:
XYZ company is a German multinational company that produces baking powder, cake mixes, frozen pizza, pudding, cake decoration, cornflakes, and various other products. The main hypothesis here is to improve the sales of the products and reduce the operational cost to generate profits.
Now the company wants to improve the sales with a good customer base. The business problem that can be identified to serve the purpose:
The company categorized the products into locomotives and wagons. The locomotives are the products which generates the largest additional sales whereas wagons are the products that are pulled by the locomotives. So, its important to find out the locomotives products as they are the base of an increase in sales.
These products can be identified, and we can investigate whether the company can run some promotional strategies on these product as they are contributing majorly towards the sales.
Expanding the scope in the market by generating new products.
Attracting people towards the products which are season specific like Christmas season is famous for baking, so the sales automatically rise in this season particularly on baking products.  
Understanding the demand of the products which attracts the wagon products and primarily focus on such products.
